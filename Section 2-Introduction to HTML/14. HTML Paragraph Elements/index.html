                <p>It is also really important for people who are using <strong>screen readers</strong>, so people who might be blind.</p>
                <p><span class="emphasis">Lorem Ipsum</span>; &#9875;<a href="https://lipsum.com/" target="_blank">https://lipsum.com/</a> - are bits of placeholder text. It's something that you'll come across quite a lot especially in web design. We dont have the time or energy to actually create the content just for testing & web design & that's why we use it. You'll find Lorem Ipsum even in different languages like Dutch or Polish, & you can use this tool to <strong>generate as many paragraphs, or words, or bytes, or lists as you need by simply using the Generate button</strong>.</p>
                <p>It's been in use in the print industry for many years, ever since the 1500s even, where people started laying out newspapers & they didn't have the content for the layout, they would use this placeholder text.</p>
                <p><span class="emphasis">Placeholder text</span>; it just is there so that you can see what a paragraph of text would look like.</p>
