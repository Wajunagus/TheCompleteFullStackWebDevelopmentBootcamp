            <h1>How to Ace this Course</h1>
        </div>
            <p>You've already come so far just by taking the first step, coz you know that most people who buy online courses, they never get started. So you're already one step closer to your goal.</p>
            <p>But we all know that @ some point later on, things will get more difficult, it will get more challenging, I can promise you this already.</p>
            <p>So, how can you keep this current level of motivation that you have & be able to carry it through to the difficult times?.</p>
            <p>One of the things that I find really helpful is <span class="gld">setting goals & having my goals around me</span>, like displayed on the wall while I'm working or while I'm studying.</p>
            <p>So I've created this fantastic worksheet for you so that you can start thinking about why you're doing this. Why are you learning to code?. Why are you learning the skill?. What will you be able to achieve once you've mastered it?. And what would your life look like once that happens?.</p>
            <p>Fill out the sheet with your answers & then print it out & put it somewhere where you can see it, so that when things become difficult & when your motivation takes a nosedive, you can have a look @ it & remind yourself of why you're doing it in the first place.</p>
