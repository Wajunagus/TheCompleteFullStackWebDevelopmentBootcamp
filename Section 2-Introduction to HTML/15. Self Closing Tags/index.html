                    <p>We'll, we've seen what non-void elements are, such as the paragraph element or the heading elements, & they're not void coz they have content in between.</p>
                    <p>A void element is an element where you are forbidden from putting any content inside the tag, and in fact the tag itself even looks very different</p>
                    <p class="heading-desc center-align-txt">&#8249;hr /&#8250;</p>
                    <p>Normally by convention, you'll see a space between the tag name & the forward slash.</p>
                    <p>Now, the horizontal rule is not the only void element. Another common one you'll see is the break element.</p>

                    <p>Well, it's really useful where you need to separate things onto separate lines in order to have the correct meaning. For example, if you have poems, they are in fact meant to be in the same paragraph, but they should really each be on different lines in order to make the rhyming work, or in order to make the structure of the poem correct.</p>

                        <li><p>The Don't is not very good for accessibility, which means it'll make it harder for blind users with screen readers to understand the content on your website. So I always recommend you always create new paragraph elements when you have new paragraphs & use the break element only when there is some sort of reason why you would want to separate the different lines in a single paragraph, but it still is a single paragraph such as in the case of a poem or in the case of an address.</p></li>
                        <li><p>I recommend to write your code with the end forward slash, & the reason is coz when you read your code, you as the human, it will be much easier for you to see that this is a void element & it doesn't need a closing tag so that you don't end up being confused & you can identify the void elements & the non-void elements easily & distinguish them from each other.</p></li>

                    <p>A neat trick I like to use is to simply copy the solution & go to diffchecker.com; &#9875;<a href="https://www.diffchecker.com/" target="_blank">https://www.diffchecker.com/</a>, paste in the solution code, & then paste your code & then go ahead & click find difference. And it should highlight all the places that are different in case you've misspelled something or you've done something wrong.</p>
