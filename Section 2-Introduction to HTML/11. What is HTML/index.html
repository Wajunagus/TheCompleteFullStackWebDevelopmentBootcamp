                <p>No matter what browser you like to use, all of these applications do the same thing. They take different files such as HTML, CSS & JS, & render them into a website.</p>
                <p>You can have just an HTML file, & in fact that's exactly what the first websites were created with.</p>
                <p>HTML defines the content & structure of the website.</p>
                <p><span class="emphasis bold">HyperText Markup Language</span>: <strong>HyperText/hyperlinks</strong>; pieces of text which can link to other documents in the website. They are the <strong>foundation</strong> of how an HTML website works.</p>
                <p>The world's first website created by <strong>Sir Tim Berners-Lee</strong>, who also happens to be the inventor of the internet. &#9875;<a href="https://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html" target="_blank">https://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html</a>: The website is filled with these hyperlinks marked in blue.</p>

                        <p>Its done through HTML tags</p>
                        <p>Now, in the early days of the internet, there were only very few HTML tags. These days there are loads more but realistically you're only going to be using some of the most important ones.</p>

                            <p>We narrow it down to the ones that you actually need to know, then it makes it a lot more approachable.</p>
