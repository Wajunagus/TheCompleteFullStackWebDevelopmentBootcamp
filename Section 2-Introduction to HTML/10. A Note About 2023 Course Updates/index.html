            <hr class="dotted">
                <p>This course was initially produced in 2018. Over time, technology changes so we've made small improvements and additions as needed.</p>
                <p>But sometimes, much more extensive updates are required. So during the entire year of 2023, we've been completely re-recording and revamping this course. 80% of the course is now brand-new.</p>
                <p>This includes new sections that never existed in previous versions of this course, such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p class="key">Flexbox</p></li>
                        <li><p class="key">Grid</p></li>
                        <li><p><span class="key">Postgres</span>: We've moved away from Mongo to Postgres because our research on tech recruitment showed us that companies are looking for more <strong>SQL-based DB competence</strong> and moving away from Mongo and NoSQL.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                <p>50+ hours of new content has been created and added to this course this year. So you can be assured that you are working through an up to date version of a Web Development Bootcamp.</p>
