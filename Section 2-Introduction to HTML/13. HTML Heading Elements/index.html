                <p class="emphasis">What is the purpose of heading elements?.</p>
                    <p>Well, the idea comes from book binding.</p>
                    <p>If you create a book & you create a table of contents, you'll see that there's a sort of hierarchy.</p>
                    <p>These levels are what we get to define using our HTML headings.</p>
                <p>By default the different heading levels are styled to have different sizes. h1 being the biggest & h6 being the smallest. We can of course further style this later on.</p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis">So what exactly is the difference</span>?; anything that's inside an angle bracket is a tag while the element includes the content as well as any opening or closing tags.</p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis">One important rule</span>; its not good practice to have more than one h1, coz the h1 is the very top-level heading.</p>
                    <p><span class="emphasis">Don't skip a level</span>; don't go straight from h1 to h3. Don't jump between the different level headings.</p>
                    <p>They're <strong>rules for convention</strong>, & coz we're going to be professionals, we're going to start off on the right foot & learn all the rules that we need to know.</p>

                    <p>Now, if you wanted to read up even more on the elements, then I recommend going to the professional tool, which is our Mozilla Developer Network Web Docs, &#9875;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements" target="_blank">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements</a> & they have documentation for all of the HTML elements that exist.</p>
