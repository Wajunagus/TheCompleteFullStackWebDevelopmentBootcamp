                <p>I recommend taking notes of this page coz you can actually use this as a very handy way of working out why your CSS is not working or when you're trying to do something specific & you're trying to make sure that a CSS rule gets applied.</p>
                <p>We're going to try out some quizzes to enforce these rules, & I recommend taking a photo of this page & having it side by side while you do the quiz, coz remember, we're programmers. We're not here to memorize things. You can always look @ this page when needed.</p>
                <p>So now it's time to try an exercise & write the code yourself so that we really solidify this knowledge in our minds & really get to grips with it.</p>
                <p>In the next lesson, we're going to learn how to combine different selectors so that we narrow down on a particular element that we want to select on-screen rather than simply broad stroke, setting the CSS of everything.</p>
