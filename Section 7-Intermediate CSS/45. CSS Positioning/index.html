                <p>I've created a demo website for you to interactively see what each of these different styles of positioning would look like. Now, if the font is too small coz I needed to get enough space in here to scroll, feel free to go to view & then click on zoom in & press the + button until it fits whichever size your eyes require. &#9875;<a href="https://appbrewery.github.io/css-positioning/" target="_blank">https://appbrewery.github.io/css-positioning/</a></p>

                <p>Notice how in all four different positional values, I've set it to have a top & a left, & this is how we position things in addition to that "position property." You can also change & set it to instead of left, you can change it to right.</p>
                <p>But in addition, you can also add extra margin.</p>
                <p>&#x231A;21:34 / 22:50: So if you wanted this circle to be bang in the middle, you would actually have to specify different values for the top & the left.</p>
                <p>I want to make sure you really try to understand the lesson, coz pushing through with the code is not going to help you unless you actually understand what you're doing.</p>
                <p class="key">Coding is all about thinking.</p>
                <p>It's not about memorizing things, it's not about knowing the answer coz you're going to get a different situation in the future & you need to make sure you know why things happen, & that requires a little bit of struggle.</p>
                <p>Now that we know a little bit more about positioning, we can head over to the next lesson where I've got a final project for this section where we're going to create the flag of Laos using everything we've learned so far.</p>
