And once we learn the different ways of combining selectors, of the specificity of CSS selectors, positioning things, different properties, you can in fact eventually create crazy stuff like this, if you have a ton of time & probably an artistic streak as well.</p>

                <p>So we're going to consolidate what we learned in this lesson by creating the flag of Laos. And this is going to test everything you've learned about combining different CSS selectors, about CSS specificity, the CSS cascade, & also about positioning.</p>
                <p>The index.html is purposely vague in terms of classes & IDs & nothing is really tagged with anything. And this is coz we're doing a challenge, right? So that's why the initial index.html has basically nothing for you to be able to target with your selectors. Instead, you have to be a little bit more crafty.</p>
                <p>The flag doesn't have to be centered or positioned in any sort of particular way.</p>
                <p>You can do this in many, many different ways. And the main thing I want to know is that you know how to combine selectors, you know about CSS specificity & you know how to position things roughly on screen.</p>

                <p>The inspiration for this project comes from a website I came across by Michael Lascarides, & he basically classified world flags in order of difficulty to draw. &#x2693;<a href="http://lascarid.es/fussyflags/" target="_blank">All of the world's flags, ranked by fussiness</a></p>
