                <p>In this lesson, we're going to focus more on how to combine different CSS selectors so that we can target a very specific element in our website in order to apply our style.</p>

                <p>It's really important for any of the upcoming challenges that you don't change any of the HTML code. So don't add any extra classes, don't add any ids, basically don't touch the entire index.html file.</p>
                <p>Instead, you're going to be writing all of your code inside the style.css & you're going to be using CSS & more specifically, the different combinations of CSS selectors in order to carry out the challenge goals.</p>
                <p>In the next lesson, we're going to look @ the CSS position property so that we can learn more about how the positioning of items works in CSS.</p>
