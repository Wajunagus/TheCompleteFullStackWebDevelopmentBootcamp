            <p>In this project, we're going to be creating a website where we list the words in, well, in this case in Spanish.</p>
            <p>It could be any other language you choose, & we're going to match it with an image of a particular color so that we learn all the colors in our foreign language.</p>

            <p>I don't want you to change anything inside the index.html. instead, all of your work is going to happen inside the CSS file, which you will create.</p>
            <p>In order to complete this project, I've created some steps for you in the TODOs which you can follow.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, you can simply look @ the goal image & try to figure that out yourself.</p>
