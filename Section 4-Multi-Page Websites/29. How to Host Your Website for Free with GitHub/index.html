            <p>Welcome to this bonus lesson on hosting your website.</p>
            <p><span class="emp bld">What exactly is Web Hosting?</span>: It's basically the process of making your websites available anywhere on the internet.</p>
            <p><span class="emp bld">How do we do that?</span>: Well, in order for it to be available to everyone, first we have to put our website & all of the files & data that it consists of, so our index.html, our images, etc, all onto a web server.</p>
            <p>What's different about a web server is that it's actually connected to the internet. So what that means is that the stuff that you put on there will be available 24/7 & ready for anyone from anywhere in the world to access all of these files. And that's what's required to be able to view your website.</p>
            <p>Now @ the moment you're able to view your website locally coz all of the files are on your computer. Right? And this is what we call <span class="key">local development</span>. It means that all of the files & folders are locally available on your computer.</p>
            <p>It's this process of taking all of the files & folders that make up your website & putting that onto a web server that's hooked up to the internet, this process is what we call web hosting.</p>
        </main>
        <main>
            <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">https://github.com/</a>
            <ol>
                <li>Now you'll only see the private option if you actually pay for a GitHub account, but we want to be able to host our website for everyone to see, so we want to make sure that public is the one we select.</li>
                <li>Then go ahead & tick the box & add a README file. This is very important, otherwise it might be quite difficult for us to upload our files.</li>
                <li>Then finally go ahead & click "<span class="key">Create Repository</span>".</li>
            </ol>
            <p>It's really important that your home page code is inside index.html coz this is what GitHub is going to look to in order to render your homepage. It's a good idea to also just check the spelling & make sure it's a lowercase "i" & its index.html.</p>
            <p>Now, again of note, it's important that you don't drag the entire folder in, that's not going to work, you want to drag in the contents of that folder.</p>
            <p>Now, once that's done, you can see it has uploaded all of those files & now you can click on "<span class="key">Commit changes</span>" to add those files to GitHub.</p>
            <p>Once your files have processed, which can take several minutes & you might need to refresh the page a few times in order to get the page up & running, then make sure that all of your folders & files are definitely listed, if they're not, then you might have to go ahead & upload them again.</p>
            <p>Once you've verified that, then go into <strong>Settings</strong>, & inside Settings navigate to <strong>Pages</strong> & then inside Pages we're going to change the part under <strong>Branch</strong>. So we're going to change from <span class="key">none</span> to <span class="key">main branch</span> which contains our root folder & all of the files that we just uploaded. So go ahead & hit Save for that to go through.</p>
            <div class="img80">
                <img src="./assets/images/Your site is live at-confirmation.png" alt="Your site is live at-confirmation">
                <p>Once that's done, you should be able to refresh the page a couple of times & you should see this little pop up which says that your site is live @ this location.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Now, just another heads up, this process can take anywhere between 1 to 10 minutes. Depending on how busy GitHub is, how many people are using it, this process can take a while.</p>
            <div class="img80">
                <img src="./assets/images/Error message.png" alt="Error message.">
                <p>Now, this is an important point, sometimes you might get this error message, simply just go back & try again.</p>
                <img src="./assets/images/Visit site.png" alt="Visit site">
                <p>Once you've refreshed this particular page & you see this little box here, then that means we're ready to go ahead & visit our website. So click on Visit site, & you can check to see all the pages work & make sure that's exactly how you had it locally.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Once you're done, you can take this url & share it with anybody across the world & they will be able to see your portfolio.</p>
