                <p>In this project, you're going to be building your very first Web Developer Portfolio. It's a website where you're going to be able to show off all of your work.</p>

                <div class="dac50">
                    <img src="./assets/images/Web Developer Portfolio.png" alt="Web Developer Portfolio.png" class="ctr75">
                    <p>Most web developers & designers out there will have their own website where they actually show people what they've built before & link to those websites that they've created so that if somebody wanted to hire you, they would be able to look @ this page, see what you've done, & then maybe contact you or learn more about you. And this is the website we're going to make, but we're going to make a very simple version of it using just HTML.</p>

                <p>Later on we're going to be putting this live on the internet, which you can share with anybody in the world.</p>
                <p>Just like any real web developer working professionally, you would split your big task creating this portfolio website into smaller tasks such as here are 7 TODO's.</p>
                <p>I want you to really put some time & energy into this portfolio coz it's going to be shown off to the entire world.</p>
                <p>In the next lesson there's a bonus lesson where I want to show you how to put this live onto the Internet so that you can share it with your friends & share it with us; the other students & myself.</p>
