            <h1>File Paths</h1>
            <p class="h1Desc">Absolute & Relative Paths</p>
        </div>
            <p>In this lesson, we're going to be introducing a concept that is related to computing but is also super important for web development, & that's this idea of file paths. The absolute & relative paths, what they are, & how they work.</p>
            <p>You can think of a file path as a unique location for a file or folder on your computer.</p>
            <p>A file path can direct someone to a file or a folder. I could direct the computer to a particular file, or towards a particular folder & I would do both of those things using a file path.</p>

            <h2>Absolute File Path</h2>
                <p>It's a file path that is relative to the root of the computer, that is the C: drive or the Macintosh HD. And then we can use the file path to direct to a specific location using the absolute file path.</p>

                <p>An absolute file path is really useful when you're navigating on a computer coz no matter where you are currently within the file structure, you can always tell them the absolute file path & the computer would know how to go from the very beginning into that destination that you specified.</p>

            <h2>Relative File Path</h2>
                <p>Now, for web development, a more useful type of file path is a relative file path. As the name suggests, it's relative to something, right? So what is it relative to? It is relative to the location where we are writing our code.</p>

                <img src="./assets/images/relative file path.png" alt="relative file path.png" class="ctr75">
                <p>If you think of your starting point as the index.html, then relative to it we can first go to the Images folder, & then inside Images folder we direct to the cat.png.</p>
                <p>Usually relative file paths are a little bit shorter & also more importantly, it doesn't matter if you move your folders around, it's always going to be valid. For example, if the Project folder got moved into a different folder, or if it became nested inside another folder, then this particular relative file path is still always going to be valid.</p>
                <p>In web development, when we're referring to a particular resource, say we want to bring up an image, or sound, or a movie, or another HTML file, we usually will use a relative file path.</p>

                <p>File paths are a very complex topic, so give it enough time.</p>
                <p>Let's translate that file path into actual text.</p>
