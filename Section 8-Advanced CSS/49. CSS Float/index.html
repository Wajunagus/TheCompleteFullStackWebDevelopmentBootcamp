                <p>I want to cover another CSS property that's really important for layout & that is the Float.</p>
                <p>And the main thing that this allows us to do is to wrap text around a particular element.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="dac50">
                <img src="./assets/images/The old newspaper.png" alt="The old newspaper.png">
                <p>If we wanted our text to be able to wrap around another element, such as in this case where it's kind of the misshapen L, then this is going to require us to use the Float Property.</p>
                <p>The web really is an extension of print.</p>
                <p>Previously we used to have these newspapers, & the way we lay out images & text is kind of what we've borrowed in order to create the websites that we see these days.</p>
                <p class="key">You realize very often in the world how so many things get reused in different ways & getting good @ a particular thing, like laying out newspapers, even if this skill dies, it still usually gets transferred into something else.</p>

                <p>Essentially, if we had a normal HTML file respecting the normal flow, then images by default have display block. So they're going to take up the full width even if they don't need to.</p>
                <p>Paragraph elements also are display blocks.</p>

                <p>And this brings me on to an important point about using float as we're doing here for layout.</p>
                <p>In the past, a lot of developers have used float extensively & sort of wrangled it to create these kind of complex layouts.</p>
                <p>Now I'm showing you this layout so you can use the clear property, but in modern web design & development, we don't have to use the float property to achieve these kind of designs coz there are much better tools for us like Flexbox, Grid, Bootstrap, a whole load of other things that is a lot less complicated to use & to understand than using float.</p>
                <p>There can be very unexpected results if you're trying to achieve complex layouts using float.</p>
                <p class="key">So I recommend to only use float when you want to wrap text around an image, & in modern web design, this is what you're going to see most people doing as well.</p>
                <p>So it's an important concept to learn & understand, but <span class="key">try to not use it on everything that you see. We've got better techniques,</span> which I'll teach you very shortly.</p>
