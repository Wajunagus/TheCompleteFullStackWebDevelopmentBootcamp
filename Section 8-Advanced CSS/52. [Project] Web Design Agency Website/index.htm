                <h1>Web Design Agency</h1>
                <p>Create a simple website for a web design agency</p>
                <hr>
            </div>
            <p>Usually with web design agencies, you'll see them demonstrating their best work, but their websites are usually quite simple.</p>
            <p>So something with a big block of text telling people what they do & then just simple clean design.</p>

            <div class="img80">
                <img src="./assets/images/Web design agency website.png" alt="Web design agency website.png">
                <p>This is what we're going to be creating.</p>
                <p>We're going to be a Creative Design Agency @ dev.com & we've got 2 little blocks of text that describes a little bit about our work, & finally, @ the bottom, we've got a footer with our company motto, "Create. Develop. Design."</p>
                <p>But more importantly, our website actually scales responsively.</p>
                <p>So when we create our website, we're going to make sure that when it's displayed on a smaller screen, namely an iPhone, that our blocks now change & are centered & are responsive to make better use of the screen real estate.</p>
                <p>So instead of having it side by side, when the screen size is a certain size, they actually stack on top of each other.</p>
                <p>So this is going to require a little bit of the knowledge that you learned in the lesson about the Display property, Floats & also Responsiveness.</p>
                <p>You can, of course, design everything completely from scratch, but I think it's important that we actually have a good pace of learning & we're practicing the things that we've actually just learned about, rather than doing everything from scratch & not focusing on the important things.</p>
                <p>Using what you've learned in this section, you should be perfectly able to add the modifications to the index.html to create the look & feel.</p>
                <p>Remember, I want you to try out putting in responsiveness & try out some of the things you learned in this section, such as block, inline-block & floats.</p>
                <p>Just put some of those things into the CSS so that you have some practice doing these things.</p>
