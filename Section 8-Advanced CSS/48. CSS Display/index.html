                    <p>In this section we're going to be diving deeper into CSS for website layout.</p>
                    <p>Now, we did a little bit of this when we touched upon CSS positioning in the last section, but we're going to look @ some other aspects of layout & we're going to start with the CSS Display Property.</p>
                    <p>There are 3 common types of display values that we're going to look @.</p>
                    <p>By default, most elements have the display set to "block", & a block is exactly what it sounds like. It's a full block.</p>
                    <p>Display property has many, many different possible values.</p>
                    <p>But the 3 that we're going to examine is block, inline, & finally a mixture of the 2, which is called inline-block.</p>
                    <p>The span has that value set to "inline"</p>
                    <p>And the unique thing about the span element that's really cool is that it's by default has a different value for the display property.</p>
                    <p>The display property can change many, many different things. And these are just some of the values that you're going to see set on the display property quite frequently.</p>
