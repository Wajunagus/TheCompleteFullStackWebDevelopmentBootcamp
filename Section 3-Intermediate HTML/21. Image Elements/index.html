            <h1>The Image Element</h1>
            <p class="h1Desc">Adding images to our websites</p>
        </div>
            <img src="./assets/images/image element.png" alt="image element.png" class="ctr75">
            <p>You'll notice that similar to the anchor tag or the anchor element that we learned about in the last lesson, the main component of an image tag that renders the image is the attribute source-"src". And what this does is it tells the image element what is the source of the image, & that's why after the = sign, the value is going to be the location of the image.</p>
            <p>One last thing to notice about the image tag is, unlike the anchor tag, it doesn't have a closing tag, instead, it is a self-closing tag, also known as a void element. Coz if you think about it, what is the text content of an image?, doesn't really make sense, right? The main content is actually the image that will be rendered from the source.</p>

            <div>
                <p>&#9875;</p>
                <img src="https://picsum.photos/200" alt="https://picsum.photos/200">
            </div>
            <p>Well, here's an example image element where we've set the source to a real life live photo on the internet. Now, when this code is rendered in a website, it will display a random image. And the reason why it's random is because I'm getting these photos from a source called picsum.photos &#9875; <a href="https://picsum.photos/">https://picsum.photos/</a> & the idea is kind of like the Lorem ipsum for placeholder photos. So when you don't really care what the photo is, but you need a photo on your website as you're creating it in order to see what it would look like, then you could use this website & you could put in the URL, which is the standard one, & then after a forward slash, you can add in the size of your image. It gives you a random image from its data bank.</p>

            <img src="./assets/images/The alt attribute.png" alt="The alt attribute.png" class="ctr75">
            <p>The other attribute for an image tag that's super important & one that you should always have is the "alt" attribute. And the "alt" attribute stands for Alternative Text Description. This is really important coz people who are blind or visually impaired, they don't look @ the internet the same way we do. They often use a screen reader, & what it does when it hits as image is it will look @ the alternative text provided.</p>

            <p>As an example, I'm using the Silktide Toolbar &#9875; <a href="https://silktide.com/toolbar/">https://silktide.com/toolbar/</a> which is a Chrome browser extension, to simulate what a person with visual impairement might hear as they're browsing.</p>

            <h2>&#128248; Capture</h2>
                <p>GIF images work exactly the same way as normal images, JPEGs or PNGs. As long as you put it into the source, it will be rendered in a website & it will start animating all by itself.</p>
