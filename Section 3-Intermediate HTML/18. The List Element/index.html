        </div>
            <p>Now, if you've spent any time around on the internet recently, you'll notice that it's completely full of lists. If you go on to BuzzFeed or any of these sort of <strong>clickbaity articles</strong>, usually they'll create a list of something such as great items that must have been invented by geniuses. But also if you look @ something like the "FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives," this is also created in this website using a list - <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/">https://www.fbi.gov/</a> - Right-click on any of these images & select Inspect, you can see that each of these photos are actually a list item placed inside an unordered list.</p>

            <p>Now, there's a whole bunch more to this website which we're going to learn in future lessons, but the really important thing is for you to see that this is a really important part that you see in websites all over on the internet. So it's really important that we understand how to use them.</p>

                    <li>I like to have list items all on the same line. This kind of helps me see visually how many list items I have, & it doesn't clutter up the list</li>
