            <p>We can actually nest a list inside another list</p>

            <h2>Nested list</h2>

            <p>Indentation makes it a lot easier visually for when we're reading code. So when you're writing code, you also are thinking about how other people are going to find reading your code.</p>

                <p>I for one, believe that you can do this if you just spend some time thinking & trying it.</p>
                <p>Now, if you didn't give that exercise a go, I want you to stop the video now, make sure that you've tried it. You're not going to learn coding through just watching me code. You're only going to learn programming by actually doing it. Solving challenges, feeling stupid sometimes, feeling like you're not good enough, but @ the end, when you do get it, when you succeed, it's going to feel amazing. And I promise you it was the same for everybody who's gone through this journey.</p>
                <p>All right, so now we've got the top of our nest, which is our A, B, & C.</p>
                <p>One of the nice things about Visual Studio Code is that it will automatically indent things as you write your code. It knows, for example, list items go inside a list. When you go to File & Save, it automatically re-indents everything for you.</p>
                <p>When you do a mistake, as we all do, you can use the nesting & indentation in order to diagnose what's wrong with your code & help you fix it.</p>
