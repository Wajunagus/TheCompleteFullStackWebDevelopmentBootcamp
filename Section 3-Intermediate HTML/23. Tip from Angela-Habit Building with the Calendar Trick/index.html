        <h1>Tip from Angela-Habit Building with the Calendar Trick</h1>
            <p>Now, I want to share with you one of my ways for building a good habit coz if we think about it, learning to code requires daily, almost constant effort, right?</p>
            <p>Ideally if you could spend 100 days & you spent 1 hour a day learning to code or coding something of your own, then you're going to become so much better than if you just did it one weekend & then forgot about it, right?</p>
            <p>So the difference between these 2 scenarios is, if you're able to build a habit, & once we have a habit, you almost don't have to think about it anymore. You just wake up, & you just do it.</p>
            <p>So how can you make coding, or learning to code a habit? One of the things that really helps me is to mark a line in my calendar, & I think this is actually something that came from Jerry Seinfeld, the comedian dude, where he said that every day he writes a new joke, he puts a line through his calendar, & by continuing that line, @ some point you're not going to want to break the chain coz it's like, "Man, I've done like a 10-day streak, how hard is it just to do 1 more day?".</p>
            <p>Most people actually benefit from continuing a streak & by about 30 or 40 days, that thing that you have to constantly think about like, do I have time today to code?, do I want to do it?, that kind of just becomes a habit & you just know, "oh, this is the time where I get sat down & I start coding", & it doesn't actually take that much motivation anymore.</p>
            <p>So try & give this a go & see if that helps you. <span class="gld">But the <strong>most important thing</strong> is to <strong>just keep going</strong>. I keep saying it but @ the end of the day, if you <strong>show up</strong>, if you <strong>do the work</strong>, then you're going to <strong>get the results</strong>.</span> So I'm here cheering for you, I think you're doing great & you're going to do even better.</p>
