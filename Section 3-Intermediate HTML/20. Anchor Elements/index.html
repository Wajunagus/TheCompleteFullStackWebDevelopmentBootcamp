            <h1>The Anchor Element</h1>
            <p class="h1Desc">Understanding HTML <span class="imp">Attributes</span></p>
        </div>
            <p>In this lesson, we're going to understand a bit more about another aspect of HTML, which is their attributes, & to understand that we're going to learn all about the anchor element, which allows us to create hyperlinks.</p>

            <img src="./assets/images/href attribute.png" alt="href attribute.png" class="ctr75">
            <p>The attribute for an HTML element goes in the opening tag. It goes into the part just after the name of the tag & just before the end of the opening tag where we have the closing angle bracket.</p>
            <p>And what an attribute does is it adds additional information to this HTML element, such as in this case where this link should link to.</p>

            <h2>The way we structure an attribute</h2>
                <img src="./assets/images/the way we structure an attribute.png" alt="the way we structure an attribute.png" class="ctr75">
                <p>So we have the name of the element, & then we have a space, & then we have the name of the attribute. And afterwards, we have an = sign & after we have the value of the attribute.</p>

                <img src="./assets/images/multiple attributes.png" alt="multiple attributes.png" class="ctr75">
                <p>Now, you can have as many attributes as you want & all you have to do is simply separate each one of them with a space & make sure that they all go into the opening tag.</p>

            <h2>&#128220; Resource</h2>
                <p>&#9875; <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a</a></p>

            <p>In addition to the specific attributes which are relevant to a particular element, there are also global attributes that every single HTML element has access to. An example is "draggable". You can apply a global attribute to any given element, so in this case we can apply it even to our anchor element.</p>
            <p>So we've learned that there are specific attributes which are reserved for only certain elements such as the "href" for the anchor tag, & there are global attributes which can be used on any HTML element.</p>

            <h2>&#9997; Exercise</h2>

            <h2>&#127939; Extra challenge</h2>
                <p>&#9875; <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol</a> - Look @ the attributes, I want you to see whether if you can change one of the attributes, the "start" attribute, so that your list instead of starting from 1, starts from 5.</p>

            <h2>&#128248; Capture</h2>
                <p>href="" - These quotation marks are here coz it's actually a piece of text that we're going to add in here. So this is treated slightly differently in code. So whenever you have text, normally you will see them enclosed inside a set of double quotes, this is to differentiate from the reserved words like li, a, or href which are all special words.</p>
                <p>Have a <strong>quick review</strong> of the <strong>concepts</strong> that are covered in this lesson & remember, <span class="gld">we're always trying to <strong>repeat</strong> things that we've learnt before just to make sure that we <strong>reinforce</strong> those pieces of <strong>knowledge</strong> from earlier on.</span> And one thing I like to do as I learn is to make some <strong>notes</strong> on the things that are new to me that I didn't realize before.</p>
