                    <h2><li>Zero experience</h2>
                        <p>I know some of the later modules are really cool & there's a temptation to jump straight to it, <span class="emphasis">but without the proper <strong>foundations</strong>, it's easy to get <strong>lost</strong> & <strong>demotivated</strong></span>.</p>
                        <p class="emphasis">Make sure that you are <strong>completely comfortable</strong> with the <strong>concepts</strong> in each module of the curriculum before moving on.</p>
                        <p>Usually, for beginners, I recommend spending a week on each module.</p>
                    </li>
                    <h2><li>Experienced Developer, New to Web</h2>
                        <p>You're probably here to quickly get up to speed with web development.</p>
                        <p>Most people in this camp will have some experience with HTML & CSS, so I recommend starting with the JavaScript modules.</p>
                        <p>As <strong><span class="key">Javascript</span> seems to live in its own land and has a number of weird features(/bugs),</strong> it might be a little shocking for people coming from safer languages (e.g. Swift).</p>
                    </li>
                    <h2><li>Experienced Web Developer</h2>
                        <p>Ok, you know Javascript, HTML and CSS like the back of your hand, but every week you hear about a new JS framework and you've decided it's finally time to buckle down and figure out what these kids are talking about.</p>
                        <p>We'll start with <span class="key">Node</span> and move on to <span class="key">Express</span>, <span class="key">EJS</span>, <span class="key">Postgres</span> and more to get you quickly up to speed (and <strong>hopefully ditch <span class="key">PHP</span></strong>).</p>
                    </li>
                    <h2><li>Want to Learn React</h2>
                        <p>Well, you seem to know what you want! That's great. I'll just show you the way to the 8-hour React module built for experienced developers:</p>
