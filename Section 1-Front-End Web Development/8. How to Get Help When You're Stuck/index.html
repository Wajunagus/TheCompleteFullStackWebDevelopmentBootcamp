                <p>With programming, it's almost a core part of the learning process that you do get stuck & you get yourself unstuck.</p>
            
                <ol>
                    <li><p>Evaluate what is the expectation versus what is the reality.</p>
                        <p>What did you expect your code to do & what actually happened & try to figure out what is causing the difference</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>Search for any errors that you come across into <span class="key">Google</span> & then heading towards the <span class="key">Stack Overflow</span> websites that come up as a result.</p>
                        <p>This is exactly what real life developers do every single day.</p>
                        <p>It's all a part of the <strong>developer workflow</strong>.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>If that still doesn't help, or you're confused by the results that you're getting back, then it's a good idea to re-watch some of the video up to the point when the code started breaking or started doing something unexpected.</p>
                        <p>Coz in the videos, there are always step by step instructions.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>You can check your code against my code.</p></li>
                    <li><p>If that still doesn't solve it, then the next step is head towards the <span class="key">Q&A</span>.</p></li>

                    <p>4 step approach to get the most helpful responses & solutions in the Q&A.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><p>What did you expect to happen</p></li>
                            <li><p>What actually happened</p></li>
                            <li><p>Screenshot of all your code that corresponds to the situation</p></li>
                            <li><p>Screenshot of the debug console that includes any errors, if there were any errors, or if your app has crashed.</p></li>
                        </ol>
                </ol>
                
                <p>It's important to remember that <strong>everybody gets stuck sometimes</strong>. And just remember that <strong>getting stuck & solving it is all a part of the learning journey</strong>.</p>
