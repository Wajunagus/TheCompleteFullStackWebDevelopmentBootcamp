        <div class="main">
            <p>In this section we're going to do a deep dive into some of the most important <strong>CSS properties</strong> that you'll see & use. And we're going to start with CSS color properties.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="main">
            <div class="subHdg">
                <h2>Named Colors</h2>
                <hr>
            </div>
            <div class="img80">

            </div>
            <p>There's a whole bunch of them out there with poetic names like cornflowerblue, cadetblue, dimgrey, olivedrab etc.</p>
            <p>And you can find all of them by, of course, going to the Developer Documentation.</p>
                <p class="inn">&#x1F4DC;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/named-color" target="_blank">&#x2329;named-color&#x232A;</a></p>
            <p>So always check the <strong>MDN Docs</strong> if you're not sure which property does what.</p>
            <p>So you can simply copy the name of the color & paste it into you code & you'll be able to see that rendered in your website.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="main">
            <div class="subHdg">
                <h2>hex codes</h2>
                <hr>
            </div>
            <div class="img40">
                <img src="./assets/images/hex codes.png" alt="hex codes.png" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                <img src="./assets/images/hex codes ii.png" alt="hex codes ii.png" style="margin-top: 0;">
            </div>
            <p>Even though there's many colors available in the default CSS named colors, but you still sometimes might want to have a more unique color palette. So what do you do in that case? Well, one of my favourite color palettes is <strong>Color Hunt</strong>. It's a free tool that's created by designers for designers & of course, for us as well.</p>
                <p class="inn">&#x1F4DC;<a href="https://colorhunt.co/palettes/popular" target="_blank">Color Hunt</a></p>
            <p>Here you've got professionally designed color palettes for colors stacked together that would look perfect on any website.</p>
            <p>But how do we use them if we don't have a name that's attached to it? Instead, we've got all these numbers & letters, what exactly are these?</p>
            <p>Well, these are "hex codes" & they are a way of representing a larger number code for that particular color.</p>
            <p>So, for example, in this case, the color purple which is formed of 3 fractions, red, green & blue. And these are colors out of 255.</p>
            <p>So, a fraction, 93 out of 255 red, 56 out of 255 green & 145 out of 255 blue.</p>
            <p>RGB Colour Sliders:</p>
            <p class="inn">&#x1F4DC;<a href="https://www.csfieldguide.org.nz/en/interactives/rgb-mixer/" target="_blank">CSFG - RGB Colour Mixer - Used by Screens</a></p>
            <p>And when you mix all 3 of these <strong>primary colors</strong>, you can get so many different types of shades.</p>
            <p>So in this case, we've got 93, 56, & 145, & we end up with exactly the same shade as the purple.</p>
            <div class="img40">
                <img src="./assets/images/RGB Colour Mixer.png" alt="RGB Colour Mixer.png">
                <p>Converting that RGB into a hex code, so a different way of representing that number, we get this particular hex code.</p>

            <p>Now, that might have required a little bit of <strong>lateral thinking</strong>, but hopefully you got there in the end.</p>
